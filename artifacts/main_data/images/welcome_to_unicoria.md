# Welcome to Unicoria

Unicoria is a small Northern European republic. It has a population of just under 6 million.

Its economy is mid-way between the very high income Scandinavian countries and the newly independent Baltic Counties.

In previous decades a period of radical free market policies has left a mixed legacy. On the positive side, Unicornia now has a flexible, service orientated labour market with very high employment levels, especially amongst the young and women. On the other, the mass redundancies that followed the decline of the old heavy industry base has left many long-term unemployed, many of whom receive sickness and disability benefits. Also, the new service-orientated has a large number of low paid and part-time jobs.

The population is ageing but this is partly mitigated by immigration.

Average income is XX per person, or YY per household. Income distribution is relatively unequal by European standards (Gini of XX). Poverty rates are quite high, with 'in-work' poverty being a particular problem due to low wages and insecure work.


## Tax system -

About 40% of Unicoria's national income is collected in tax. This, too, is mid-way between the Scandinavian counties and the newly independent Baltic states.

Unicoria has three main taxes:

* income tax - old, creaking administrative system but relatively progressive 2 rates but high tax allowance. Tax competition from near neighbours makes significant increases in income tax risky.
* employment insurance 10% of wages and self employment income - not enough to pay for generous pensions
* indirect - 20% VAT - exemption for food is unpopular with the EU but jealously guarded

There are also taxes on corporations, wealth and natural resources, plus a local property tax which part funds local government spending. together these other taxes amount to XX% of revenue.

## The Social Security System

Just under 1/2 of Government spending goes in social security. The system has evolved over nearly a century into a complex mix of means-tested and contingent benefits with a creaking administrative system

The most expensive item is state pensions. The relatively low level of employment insurance means that pensions are relatively un-generous. Many retirees have private pensions, but others rely on top-ups from means-tested benefits.

There are also large expenditures on payments to families with children, and to the sick and disabled.

However, means tested benefits are the most important tool used to boost the incomes of those on low incomes. After an unpopular experiment with the Galactic Credit negative income tax, Unicornia has reverted to a minimum income guarantee plus an in-work tax credit and housing costs support.

Pressures on the benefit system include:

* rising Housing support driven by low wages and earlier household formation;
* the ageing population causing rising pension and social care costs;
* the rise in self-employment and 'gig economy' workers.

Concern about poverty traps and complexity have led to a debate about replacing much of the benefit system with a Citizen's Income.  Preparatory work has been done so it would be administratively straightforward to introduce one.
