    Topic: Microsimulation modeling platforms

Julia is an excellent language for microsimulation projects. Julia is competitive with R or Stata for data exploration and statistics. But it’s also an excellent system for complex programming tasks, giving you code that’s easy to write, read, test and maintain, but which often runs as fast as Fortran or C. Just as important, Julia is a lot of fun.

Based on our experience of developing our new TriplePC model, I'll discuss the pros and cons of developing microsimulations in Julia, provide a brief walk-through of the internals of TriplePC, and discuss the microsimulation ecosystem in Julia.
